                        The Tirukku·πüa·∏∑ (Tamil: ‡Æ§‡Æø‡Æ∞‡ØÅ‡Æï‡Øç‡Æï‡ØÅ‡Æ±‡Æ≥‡Øç) or shortly the Kural, is a
                        classic Tamil language text consisting of 1,330 short
                        couplets.Considered one of the greatest works ever written on ethics
                        and morality, it is known for its universality and secular
                        nature.The text has been dated variously from 300 BCE to 5th century
                        CE.The Kural is traditionally praised with epithets and alternative
                        titles, including "the Tamil Veda" and "the Divine Book. Written on
                        the foundations of ahimsa, it emphasizes non-violence and moral
                        vegetarianism as virtues for an individual.The text effectively
                        denounced previously held beliefs that were common during the Sangam
                        era and permanently redefined the cultural values of the Tamil
                        land.
                        The Kural has been widely admired by scholars and influential
                        leaders across the ethical, social, political, economic, religious,
                        philosophical, and spiritual spheres over its history. These include
                        Ilango Adigal, Kambar, Leo Tolstoy, Mahatma Gandhi, Albert
                        Schweitzer, Constantius Joseph Beschi, Karl Graul, George Uglow
                        Pope, Alexander Piatigorsky, and Yu Hsi. The work remains the most
                        translated, the most cited, and the most citable of Tamil literary
                        works. The text has been translated into at least 40 Indian and
                        non-Indian languages, making it one of the most translated ancient
                        works. Ever since it came to print for the first time in 1812, the
                        Kural text has never been out of print. The Kural is considered a
                        masterpiece and one of the most important texts of the Tamil
                        Literature.

                        Thiruvalluvar (Tamil: ‡Æ§‡Æø‡Æ∞‡ØÅ‡Æµ‡Æ≥‡Øç‡Æ≥‡ØÅ‡Æµ‡Æ∞‡Øç), commonly known as Valluvar, was
                        a celebrated Tamil poet and philosopher. He is best known as the
                        author of the Tirukku·πüa·∏∑,The text is considered an exceptional and
                        widely cherished work of the Tamil literature. Almost no authentic
                        information is available about Valluvar, states Kamil Zvelebil a
                        scholar of Tamil literature.Little is known with certainty about his
                        family background, religious affiliation, or birthplace. He is
                        believed to have lived at least in the town of Mylapore (a
                        neighbourhood of the present-day Chennai), and his floruit is dated
                        variously from fourth century BCE to early fifth century CE, based
                        on the traditional accounts and the linguistic analyses of his
                        writings. Maraimalai Adigal gives 31 BCE as the birth year of
                        Valluvar, while Kamil Zvelebil infers the Tirukku·πüa·∏∑ and Valluvar
                        are best dated to around 500 CE. Valluvar has influenced a wide
                        range of scholars down the ages since his time across the ethical,
                        social, political, economical, religious, philosophical, and
                        spiritual spheres. He has long been venerated as a great sage, and
                        his literary works a classic of Tamil culture.
